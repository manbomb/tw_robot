A Twitter robot with timed messages. Simple and efficient.

1. Edit in the tw_robot.py the variables consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_token, access_token_secret with your own values of your application. If you want to see more: [Click Here !](http://docs.tweepy.org/en/latest/auth_tutorial.html)
2. You will need two archives: 'list.txt' and 'hashtags.txt'. Create them if necessary.
3. list.txt: this is the archive of messages and times. Write like this:

        09:08:30 - Message Here
        09:09:30 - Message Here 2
        09:10:30 - Message Here 3

### Recommendations about 'list.txt':
- Do not repeat messages. This can cause an error.
- Minimum interval between two messages: 15 secs.

### Tips about 'list.txt':
- The pointer can catch only one message per time. If there is two or more messages in same time, the pointer will catch one per day.

4. hashtags.txt: this is the archive of hashtags. Each message has 4 hashtags, randomly chosed here. Write like this:

        covid19
        coronavirusbrasil
        brasil
        coronavirusmaringa
        maringa
        covid2019
        washhands

### Recommendations about 'hashtags.txt':
- separate hashtags with a line break.
- do not write the #, only the words.
    
5. Run the tw_robot.py
6. If you update something in the hashtags.txt or list.txt, prees the R key to refresh.
7. If you want to quit, press the Q key to quit.
